This is a basic introduction to Milvus by PyMilvus.

For a runable python script, checkout `example.py <https://github.com/milvus-io/pymilvus/blob/master/examples/example.py>`_
on PyMilvus github, or `hello milvus <https://milvus.io/docs/v0.11.0/example_code.md>`_ on milvus offical website. It's a good recommended start to get started with Milvus and PyMilvus as well.
