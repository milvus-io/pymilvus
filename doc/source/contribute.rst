For a feature
    You can tell us why you need it and we will decide whether to implement it soon.
    If we think it's a good improvement, we will make it a feature request and start to work on it. It's
    also welcomed for you to open an issue with your PR as a solution.

For a bug
    You need to tell us as much information as possible, better start with our
    `bug report template <https://github.com/milvus-io/pymilvus/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.md&title=%5BBUG%5D>`_.
    With information, we can reproduce the bug easily and solve it later.
