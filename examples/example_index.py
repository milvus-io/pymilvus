"""
This is an example of creating index

We will be using `films.csv` file, You can obtain it from here
(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/milvus-io/pymilvus/0.3.0/examples/films.csv)
There are 4 columns in films.csv, they are `id`, `title`, `release_year` and `embedding`,
all the data are from MovieLens `ml-latest-small` data except id and embedding, those two are fake values.

We will be using `films.csv` to demonstrate how can we build index and search by index on Milvus.
We assuming you have went through `example.py` and have a basic conception about how to communicate with
Milvus by pymilvus.

This example is runnable for Milvus(0.11.x) and pymilvus(0.3.x).

# ------
# Basic create index:
#     Now that we have a collection in Milvus with `segment_row_limit` 4096, we can create index or
#     insert entities.
#
#     We can call `create_index` BEFORE we insert any entities or AFTER. However Milvus won't actually
#     start build index task if the segment row count is smaller than `segment_row_limit`. So if we want
#     to make Milvus build index, we need to insert number of entities larger than `segment_row_limit`.
#
#     We are going to use data in `films.csv` so you can checkout the structure. And we need to group
#     data with same fields together, so here is a example of how we obtain the data in files and transfer
#     them into what we need.

# ------
# Basic create index:
#     Now that we have inserted all the films into Milvus, we are going to build index with these data.
#
#     While building index, we have to indicate which `field` to build index for, the `index_type`,
#     `metric_type` and params for the specific index type. In our case, we want to build a `IVF_FLAT`
#     index, so the specific params are "nlist". See pymilvus documentation
#     (https://milvus-io.github.io/milvus-sdk-python/pythondoc/v0.3.0/index.html) for `index_type` we
#     support and the params accordingly.
#
#     If there are already index for a collection and you call `create_index` with different params, the
#     older index will be replaced by new one.

#     If we want to use index, the specific index params need to be provided, in our case, the "params"
#     should be "nprobe", if no "params" given, Milvus will complain about it and raise a exception.
