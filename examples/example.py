# ------
# Setup:
#    First of all, you need a runing Milvus(0.11.x). By default, Milvus runs on localhost in port 19530.
#    Then, you can use pymilvus(0.3.x) to connect to the server, You can change the _HOST and _PORT accordingly.
# ------
_HOST = '127.0.0.1'
_PORT = '19530'
client = Milvus(_HOST, _PORT)

# ------
# Basic create collection:
#     You already have a Milvus instance running, and pymilvus connecting to Milvus.
#     The first thing we will do is to create a collection `demo_films`. Incase we've already had a collection
#     named `demo_films`, we drop it before we create.
# ------

# Basic create collection:
#     `auto_id` in the parameter is set to `False` so that we can provide our own unique ids.
#     `embedding` in the `fields` is float vector with dimension of 8.
#     For all fields, you can provide custom infos in "params" like {"unit": "minute"}
#     For FLOAT_VECTOR and BINARY_VECTOR, "dim" is a must in "params".
#     For more information you can refer to the pymilvus
#     documentation (https://milvus-io.github.io/milvus-sdk-python/pythondoc/v0.3.0/index.html).

# Basic search entities:
#     Now that we have 3 films inserted into our collection, it's time to obtain them.
#     We can get films by ids, if milvus can't find entity for a given id, `None` will be returned.
#     In the case we provide below, we will only get 1 film with id=1 and the other is `None`
# ------

# ------
# Basic hybrid search entities:
#      Getting films by id is not enough, we are going to get films based on vector similarities.
#      Let's say we have a film with its `embedding` and we want to find `top3` films that are most similar
#      with it by L2 distance. And there are some conditions for the results. We want to obtain films that are:
#      `released in year` 2002 or 2003,
#      `duration` of the films larger than 250 minutes.
#
#      "range" includes "GT"(>), "LT"(<), "LTE"(<=), "GTE"(>=).
#      There are more options other than "must", for instance "should", for more information, you can refer to
#      pymilvus documentation (https://milvus-io.github.io/milvus-sdk-python/pythondoc/v0.3.0/index.html).

# Basic hybrid search entities:
#     And we want to get all the fields back in reasults, so fields = ["duration", "release_year", "embedding"].
#     If searching successfully, results will be returned.
#     `results` have `nq`(number of queries) seperate results, since we only query for 1 film, The length of
#     `results` is 1.
#     We ask for top 3 in-return, but our condition is too strict while the database is too small, so we can
#     only get 1 film, which means length of `entities` in below is also 1.
#
#     Now we've gotten the results, and known it's a 1 x 1 structure, how can we get ids, distances and fields?
#     It's very simple, for every `topk_film`, it has three properties: `id, distance and entity`.
#     All fields are stored in `entity`, so you can finally obtain these data as below:
#     And the result should be film with id = 3.
# ------

        print("- embedding: {}".format(current_entity.embedding))

# ------
# Basic delete:
#     Now let's see how to delete things in Milvus.
#     You can simply delete entities by their ids.
# ------
client.delete_entity_by_id(collection_name, ids=[1, 2])
client.flush()  # flush is important
result = client.get_entity_by_id(collection_name, ids=[1, 2])

counts_delete = sum([1 for entity in result if entity is not None])
counts_in_collection = client.count_entities(collection_name)
print("Get {} entities by id 1, 2".format(counts_delete))
print("There are {} entities after delete films with 1, 2".format(counts_in_collection))

# ------
# Basic delete:
#     You can drop partitions we create, and drop the collection we create.
# ------
client.drop_partition(collection_name, partition_tag='American')
if collection_name in client.list_collections():
    client.drop_collection(collection_name)

# ------
# Summary:
#     Now we've went through all basic communications pymilvus can do with Milvus server, hope it's helpful!
